This repository contains implementations of four machine learning regression models used for predictive analysis:
  
Random Forest (RF)

Generalized Additive Model (GAM)

Cubist Regression

Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

The code includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. These models are designed to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships and can be applied to structured tabular datasets for regression tasks.

This repository is intended for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in comparing different regression approaches and understanding their practical implementation.
